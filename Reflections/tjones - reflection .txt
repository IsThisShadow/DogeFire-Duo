For this project I was mainly tasked with making sure that the code worked and that the merges went smoothly.
I also made the first prototype for the health system, including the flashing red indecating you've been hit and giving invecenablitly
I also made the tip screen and the base for the other screens like the menu, controls, death, and win screen
I ende up making the test player that would then be scrapped and used for the main player for the health and collions
The main issue I ever had working on this project was at the start when we all finshed the basic requirments for each branch. 
And needed to merge, it took mulitple different test branches to get them to merh properly without any issues. But after that
I would say it was smooth sailing. I got to work with the basic node I'm used to which made proggrsion on my side fast
The font was easy to change, and the modles where easy to work with.
espcially with Dan carrying most of the code whenever he got him.
