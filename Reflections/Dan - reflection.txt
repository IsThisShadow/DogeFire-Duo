For this project I was mainly tasked with making the map for the game and making the UI. 
I started by using parallax layers to make the map look as if it had depth as the player moves through the world.
A small issue that I ran into was making a character capable of testing my parallax background. 
I ended up making a "test guy" with the bare minimum code and properties needed to move around the map for testing.
The big challenge here was getting the hang of using brand new nodes, and finding the right assets for the map. 
I knew that how our map looked would be a big part of our game, so I wanted it to fit the theme/aesthetic of the game. 
Our game is designed as a side-scroller, so the next step was to make the map scroll automatically, without the player 
having to move around to achieve the parallax effect. 
This was a struggle, but after getting it done the map was completed. 
This was a big part of the project so I was glad to have it done. 
Next I began to work on improving the UI of the game. 
Gavy made the bare bones for the loading screens, title screens, pause screens, etc. 
So my job was to go in and change images, fonts, arrangements, and anything else needed to make the screens fit the 
aesthetic of the game, and provide the user with a good and intuitive experience.
With each new screen, I focused on the C.R.A.P. acronym for good UI.
The hardest screen to polish the UI for was the first one, but after I set precedents, making the others was much easier
since the others were very similar to avoid user confusion.
