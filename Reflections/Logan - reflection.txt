	I picked out the font for the Game and designed the home screen
	I start making the enemies
	It figured out how to make the enemies move up and down and have varried movement
	I added a second enemy that is faster
	Made enemies spawn in waves and and get harder over time
	made enimies shoot bullets at different speeds and sizes 
	cleaned up a lot of UIs and made them look prettier 
	made the buttons be arranged in a clean order
	I had trouble figuring out how to move around the buttons without moving them all at once
	i also desighned how the health and progress bar looks 
	I made the controlls menu and designed how its laid out
